We have to create Loadbalancer for the weblayer to distribute the load across the web servers deployed. we can have autoscaling groups setup for the WEB SERVERS and APPLICATION SERVER. This way we will have our application server abstracted and protected from being directly accessed via public network. The Web server which is exposed to the public network will communicate with the application server to serve the required data to the users. Since the application server is also exempted from serving static content, this will even improve the performance of the application server.
